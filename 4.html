      Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment
      that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets
      developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
      scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content
      before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
      represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application
      development around a single programming language, rather than different
      languages for server- and client-side scripts. Though .js is the standard
      filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer
      to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the
      product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous
      I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in
      web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for
      real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and
      browser games).[7] The Node.js distributed development project was
      previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with
      the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by
      the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9] Corporate users
      of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12]
      LinkedIn,[13][14] Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] Rakuten,
      SAP,[20] Voxer,[21] Walmart,[22] and Yahoo!.[23]
