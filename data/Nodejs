Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment
    that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets
    developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side
    scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content
    before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js
    represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application
    development around a single programming language, rather than different
    languages for server- and client-side scripts. Though .js is the standard
    filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer
    to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the
    product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous
    I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in
    web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for
    real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and
    browser games).[7] The Node.js distributed development project was
    previously governed by the Node.js Foundation,[8] and has now merged with
    the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by
    the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[9] Corporate users
    of Node.js software include GoDaddy,[10] Groupon,[11] IBM,[12]
    LinkedIn,[13][14] Microsoft,[15][16] Netflix,[17] PayPal,[18][19] Rakuten,
    SAP,[20] Voxer,[21] Walmart,[22] and Yahoo!.[23]
