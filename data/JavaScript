JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS, is a
      programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7]
      JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
      It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
      object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS,
      JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[8]
      JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web
      applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page
      behavior,[9] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine
      to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports
      event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
      application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates,
      regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object
      Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any
      input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities,
      as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.
      Originally used only in web browsers, JavaScript engines are also now
      embedded in server-side website deployments and non-browser applications.
      Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including
      language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
      languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
